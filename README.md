## Summary

There is a need for data resources and benchmarks that quantify how much variation exposures explain in phenotype risk to identify missing gaps in our knowledge of disease etiology. At a bare minimum, such a resource and benchmark will allow for comparison and contextualization of associations between exposures and phenotypes that emerge from other longitudinal cohorts and biobanks (US All of US, UK Biobank) to prioritize in clinical investigation, and, to enhance study design and power for future cohort or model-based studies.

We build a comprehensive "atlas" of correlations between 278 phenotypes (e.g., body mass index, glucose, height, creatinine) and 651 exposures and behaviors (e.g., self-reported nutrient intake; blood lead levels; urinary phthalates; blood PFOA) across the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), estimating 127,817 associations in individuals from 1999-2017. For each survey, we associate the phenotype and exposure, and summarize the association size across the surveys. We assess the robustness of associations by estimating the false discovery rate, consistency with adjustments, and concordance across multiple waves of the surveys.

Specifically, the atlas provides a comprehensive list of exposure-phenome associations across the cohort, document statistical approaches used to associate exposures with phenotype, and systematically assesses replicability across independent cohorts.
